# Setup
To use this project, clone this repository and open it in Unity, ideally version 2022.1.21f1 or later.

The MainScene is an example of how the game's objects should be set up.

As this is a template game, a lot of information is displayed in Unity's debug logs. It also helps to enable Gismos in the Game view to see a lot of debug visualisations for features like noise spawning and enemy line of sight.
